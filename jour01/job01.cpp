    char c = '\x01';
        Type: char
        Value: '\x01' is the hexadecimal representation of the value 1. Since the char data type is used, the variable c will hold the ASCII character with the code 1, which is a control character (Start of Header) and not a printable character.

    short int p = 10;
        Type: short int
        Value: The value is simply 10, which is an integer value assigned to the variable p.

            x = p + 3
        Type: The type of the expression will be the same as the type of p, which is short int.
        Value: p + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13.
        Therefore, x is a short int with a value of 13.

    y = c + 1
        Type: The type of the expression will be int because both char and integer arithmetic are involved.
        Value: c + 1 = 1 + 1 = 2 because c has a value of 1 (\x01) and adding 1 results in 2.
        Therefore, y is an int with a value of 2.

    z = p + c
        Type: The type of the expression will be int because short int and char arithmetic are involved.
        Value: p + c = 10 + 1 = 11.
        Therefore, z is an int with a value of 11.

    w = 3 * p + 5 * c
        Type: The type of the expression will be int because the expression involves arithmetic with short int and char, resulting in integer arithmetic.
        Value: 3 * p + 5 * c = 3 * 10 + 5 * 1 = 30 + 5 = 35.
        Therefore, w is an int with a value of 35.

In summary:

    x is a short int with a value of 13.
    y is an int with a value of 2.
    z is an int with a value of 11.
    w is an int with a value of 35.
