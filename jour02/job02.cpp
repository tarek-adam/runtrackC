Here is an analysis of what the C++ program will display for the different values of n:

    Switch statement: The program uses a switch statement to perform a specific action based on the value of n. However, there is an error in the syntax: there should not be a semicolon (;) after switch(n).
    Lack of break statements in some cases: Cases for 0 and 2 do not have a break statement at the end of their block. This means that the execution will continue from these cases until it encounters a break or the switch statement ends.
    Default case: The default case will be executed if n does not match any of the other specified cases.

Here's what the program will display for each value of n:

    For n = 0:
        Execution begins with the case 0 and prints "Nul\n".
        It then continues to the case 1 and 2, printing "Petit\n".
        After that, it reaches a break in the case 2 and stops executing.
        Therefore, the program displays "Nul\nPetit\n" for n = 0.

    For n = 1:
        Execution begins with the case 1 and continues to 2.
        It prints "Petit\n" and then reaches a break in the case 2.
        Therefore, the program displays "Petit\n" for n = 1.

    For n = 4:
        Execution begins with the case 3 and continues through 4 and 5 without interruption (since they are grouped).
        It prints "Moyen\n".
        Therefore, the program displays "Moyen\n" for n = 4.

    For n = 10:
        There are no cases that match n = 10.
        Therefore, the default case is executed, and it prints "Grand\n".
        The program displays "Grand\n" for n = 10.

    For n = -5:
        There are no cases that match n = -5.
        Therefore, the default case is executed, and it prints "Grand\n".
        The program displays "Grand\n" for `n = -5".
